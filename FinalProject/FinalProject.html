                <p><strong>Chamique Holdsclaw</strong>, 41, from Queens, New York is known to be one of the first female athletes to speak out about mental illness. She grew up training and playing basketball in hopes of one day becoming one of the best athletes in the country. She led her high school team to the New York State Championships four years in a row, which resulted in being name a High School All-American. As one of the best basketball players in New York, she signed her letter of intent for a basketball scholarship to play for, arguably the best women’s basketball coach of all time, Pat Summit at the University of Tennessee. She attended the University of Tennessee from 1995-1999 and helped lead the program to is first ever undefeated season going 39-0 in 1998. With two SEC regular season titles and three SEC tournament champions, Holdsclaw finished her collegiate career scoring 3,025 points and 1,295 rebounds. She left the University of Tennessee as the all-time leading scorer and rebounder, as well as all-time leading scorer in the SEC women’s history. Although, she setting and achieving superstar goals, she failed to share how she was truly feeling on the inside. </p>

                <p>Raised by her grandmother in Queens, Holdsclaw told <a href="http://www.espn.com/espnw/culture/sports-business-leadership/summit/2017-summit/article/20924301/chamique-holdsclaw-shares-struggles-mental-illness-hopes-helping-others">ESPN</a>, arriving on Tennessee’s campus was a complete shock. Her decision to move and be raised by her grandmother at a young age is when she began to think about her personal health issues “because her father [also] had mental health issues, including dealing with schizophrenia,” ESPN reports.</p>

                <blockquote class="bq1">
                <p>People called me crazy. An enigma. Lost. All these things. And the whole time in the back of my head, I'm like, 'that's not who I am.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>With mental illness in her genetic make up, her anxiety in college turned in isolation and depression as she began her WNBA career. Holdsclaw was selected No. 1 overall in the 1999 WNBA Draft to the Washington Mystics and received Rookie of the Year. As her hardwork on the court continued to pay off over the years, here mental health declined.</p>


                <p>ESPN’s Kate Fagan wrote, “Holdsclaw said that at various points of her career, she would isolate herself, especially when she was at her low points, because she didn’t want people to know abut her mental illness. She shared a story about her time playing for the WNBA’s Washington Mystics, when she shut herself into her apartment, and even when [Pat] Summit showed up, having flown from Knoxville, Holdclaw didn’t answer the door.”</p>


                <p>After struggling with mental illness for the majority of her life, Holdsclaw said her health is a work in progress. Some days are obviously better than others, but she is on medication and urges people who may be struggling with their mental health, especially athletes, to speak out about it.</p>

                <h4 class="graph-text">Mental health illnesses have become a huge epidemic of the American culture and sadly, the awareness at the national level does not seem to be enough. According to Suicide Awareness Voices of Education, 123 Americans die by suicide a day. Suicide is currently the 10th leading cause of death in the United States for all ages and just the 2nd leading cause of death in the world.</h4>

                <a name="MH"><h3>What does it look like?</h3></a>
                <p><strong>However</strong>, mental health issues is much more than attempting suicide or even physically harming yourself. Mental illnesses takes form in a variety of ways like: social anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol/substance abuse, eating disorders, and many <a href="https://namica.org/resources/mental-illness/types-mental-illness/">more.</a>
                Dealing with these stressors for people of any age, race, etc. can be detrimental to humans livelihood, but for college athletes it can oftentimes be worse.</p>

                <p>For student-athletes, their main focus is usually their academics and their sport. There is not much time or energy for more. Between attending classes, office hours, study halls, studying, practices, treatment, weight lifting, conditioning and more, there is barely enough time to call home and speak to their families at the end of the day. Now, think about athletes who happen to deal with depression or anxiety, or even an eating disorder. Who do they go to for help? What does the support system look like for students who are away from home and dealing with a internal situation?</p>

    <h3>What do doctors say?</h3>
    <p><strong>Jason Freeman</strong> is one of two sports psychologists at the University of Virginia, just one of the few Division I institutions in the country that have a full-time sports psychology department in the athletics department. Freeman, received his bachelor's from Duke University and his Masters and Ph.D. in clinical psychology from George Mason University. He has been at the University of Virginia, initially working in neurology psychology for sports concussions, before becoming a full-time sports psychologist in the athletic department. UVa was one of the first institutions in the country to have sports psychology in housse following the death of Yeardley Love, a women’s lacrosse players who was murdered by her boyfriend, a men’s lacrosse player in 2011. <p>

  	<p>In 2011, UVa athletics started it’s sports psychology department with one full-time psychologist before Dr. Freeman came along in 2014. Unfortunately, it took the death of an athlete to realize how mental health is more prominent than what the public realized.<p>

      <blockquote class="bq2">
              <p>"Athletics does represent a special population because student-athletes have different time demands and have restrictions that make utilization of traditional campus resources more challenging." -Jason Freeman, Sports Psychologist at UVa</p>

 <h2>Responses from student-athletes (2015)</h2>
 <p>Over the past five years college campuses have generally seen an increase in the number of students experencing mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. This data shows different <strong>percentages</strong> of responses from student-athletes given their experience with mental health issues. </p>

                  <h3>Biggest Problem</h3>
                  <p><strong>There</strong> are very few full-time athletic department sport psychologist. According to <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/sport-science-institute/mind-body-and-sport-psychologist-perspective"> NCAA.org</a>, the position is typically held by a licensed counseling/clinical psychologist with graduate training in physical education/psychology.<p>
                  <div class="fulltime"><strong>Full-time sport psychologist usually:</strong>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                  <li>provide individual counseling for student-athletes</li>
                  <li>coordination of substance abuse/eating disorder services for student-athletes</li>
                  <li>team consultation for both clinical and performance issues, staff education and consultation</li>
                  <li>and consultation with athletics administration</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
          </div>

          <img src="collegecounseling.jpg" style="width:500px;height:300px;margin: 0 auto;">
</div>
<br>
          <p>Additionally, the NCAA says that some athletics departments retain external consultants or counseling center staff psychologists who are given time to work within the athletics department.They usually work 10-30 hours as opposed to 40-50,
          coordinate a sports psychology service “program” that identifies specific individuals (i.e. substance abuse counselor at counseling center, mental skills consultant in physical education department) to be part of the team that the primary consultant coordinates, supervises and directs.</p>
          <p><i>Schools that have part-time positions: Purdue, Wisconsin, Stanford, Oregon State, Minnesota, Nevada, Maryland and Oklahoma State.</i><p>

<hr style="border: 1px solid#000000;"/>

          <h3>What's next?</h3>
          <p><strong>It is clear</strong> that full-time positions are the better options however, simply having the resources does not always fix the problem. There is one aspect of mental health that most psychologists like Dr. Freeman would happy to do their jobs without; the stigma.</p>
          <ul>Dr. Freeman said he would,
          <li>Do away with: "Stigma, an aspect that all coaches, nutritionist and stength and conditioning coaches should be cognizant off and embrace that mental health is in fact health."</li>
          <li>Continue: "Being present. Sports psychologist should not only be found in the ffices, but at practices, games, meetings, etc."</li>
          <li>See more: "Conversation. Less speaking at student-athletes about mental-health, but rather participating in open dialogue among everyoone that makes up the athletic department about how mental well being is important for human beings, but obviously athletes."</li>
        </ul>

<hr style="border: 1px solid#000000;"/>
        <h5><center>With the help of professional athletes telling their stories, the stigma of mental health has decreased due to the increase of dialogue amongst college campuses and households. The result of this has allowed people to be more comfortable with seeking the right resources.</center></h5>
