    <p>Mental-health awareness has become a huge epidemic of the American culture and sadly, the awareness at the national level is not enough. According to Suicide Awareness Voices of Education, 123 Americans die by suicide a day. Suicide is currently the 10th leading cause of death in the United States for all ages and just the 2nd leading cause of death in the world.<p>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p><strong>However</strong>, mental health is much more than attempting suicide or even physically harming yourself. Mental health takes form in a variety of ways like: social anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol/substance abuse, eating disorders, and many <a href="https://namica.org/resources/mental-illness/types-mental-illness/">more.</a>
                Dealing with these stressors for people of any age, race, etc. can be detrimental to humans livelihood, but for college athletes it can oftentimes be worse.</p>

                <p>For student-athletes, their main focus is usually their academics and their sport. There is not much time or energy for more. Between attending classes, office hours, study halls, studying, practices, treatment, weight lifting, conditioning and more, there is barely enough time to call home and speak to their families at the end of the day. Now, think about athletes who happen to deal with depression or anxiety, or even an eating disorder. Who do they go to for help? What does the support system look like for students who are away from home and dealing with a internal situation?</p>

    <p><strong>Jason</strong> Freeman is one of two sports psychologists at the University of Virginia, just one of the few Division I institutions in the country that have a full-time sports psychology department in the athletics department. Freeman, received his bachelor's from Duke University and his Masters and Ph.D. in clinical psychology from George Mason University. He has been at the University of Virginia, initially working in neurology psychology for sports concussions, before becoming a full-time sports psychologist in the athletic department. UVa was one of the first institutions in the country to have sports psychology in housse following the death of Yeardley Love, a women’s lacrosse players who was murdered by her boyfriend, a men’s lacrosse player in 2011. <p>

  	<p>In 2011, UVa athletics started it’s sports psychology department with one full-time psychologist before Dr. Freeman came along in 2014. Unfortunately, it took the death of an athlete to realize how mental health is more prominent than what the public realized.<p>

    <p>Athletics does represent a special population because student-athletes have different time demands, different geographical and restrictions that make utilization of traditional campus resources more challenging.</p> <cite>– Dr. Jason Freeman, Sport Psychologist at the University of Virginia.</cite>
